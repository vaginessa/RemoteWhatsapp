<center><h1><b><u>Welcome</u></b></h1></center>
<p>Xymen Pro is an useful app for the people who struggles to manage more than one WhatsApp on
    multiple devices. So we came up with this idea - Manage another WhatsApp on the same device.
    Isn't it cool to have remote access to your another WhatApp. We thought a while then we decided
    to take it to the next level, so we added 20 more clients to the app. YES 20 CLIENTS. Now you
    can manage upto 20 clients through a single device. No matter if your device is on Lollipop or
    Gingerbread,
    this app will gonna take you to the shore.</p>


<br><center><b>Directly start using the app by navigating to How To Use in Navigation Drawer</b></center>

</ul>

<br><b><u>TIPS:</u></b><br>
<ul>
    <li>Give some time to the page to load. It is quite a heavy page. Especially for 2G subscribers.</li>
    <li>Prefer Wifi because of the same above reason.</li>
    <li>Try to use in landscape mode. It's a bit comfortable in that way.</li>
    <li>And remove Action Bar. It makes it even more comfortable :) </li>
